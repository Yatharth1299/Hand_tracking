Just completed an AI Hand Tracking Project using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe! 🖐️✨

In this project, I developed a real-time hand tracking system that detects and tracks hand landmarks with high accuracy. Using the powerful MediaPipe framework integrated with OpenCV, the system can:

Track hand movement in real time

Enable interactive applications without external sensors

💡 This project deepened my understanding of computer vision, pose estimation, and real-time video processing using AI.

🔧 Tech Stack: Python | OpenCV | MediaPipe
📹 Applications: Virtual drawing, touchless interfaces, and more!
